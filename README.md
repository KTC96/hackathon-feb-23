​
## Initial MVP Idea:
​
Following the initial team meeting, project ideas were shared and the agreed idea was to work on creating a platform to connect people with existing NGOs and promote the work that they do. 
​
### Actual idea & content:
​
The main aim of the website is to help users find NGOs that they can donate to and or find more info about the organisation.
There is a gallery page to showcase the work of the NGOs and how peoples donations are enabling them to do the work they do.
There is a contact us page where users can contact us.
​
- File structure:
    
    - index.html
    - gallery.html
    - contact.html
    - 404.html (error handling)
    - assets folder >
        - images > 
            - ngos > ngo logo images
            - all copyright free images
        - css
          - style.css file
        - js > 
            - script.js file
            - ngos.js file

### Future Development:

* It would be nice to include database connection where all the messages from Contact Us would be save.
* We would love to create an Events page where users would create local volunteer events. The users could create and search for events on their area.
* Connect to a Map API to display the event location.
​
