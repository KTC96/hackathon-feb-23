## Initial MVP idea:
â€‹
Following the initial team meeting, project ideas were shared and the agreed idea was to work on creating a platform to connect people with existing ngos and promote the work that they do. 
â€‹
### Actual idea & content:
â€‹
The main aim of the website is to help users find ngos that they can donate to and or find more info about the organisation.
There is a gallery page to showcase the work of the ngos and how peoples donations are enabling them to do the work they do.
There is a contact us page where ngos can contact us to get added to the site.
